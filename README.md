# JAVASCRIPT-ANIMATED-NAVIGATION-TOGGLE
<p>When you build website menus using only HTML and CSS, you’re limited to creating links that move the user from one static page to another—it’s JavaScript that allows for drop down, collapsible, and otherwise animated navigation features when you’re doing web development. Animated navigation toggles are another ubiquitous part of the internet landscape that you’ll be able to crank out for clients and potential employers once you get the hang of the JavaScript programming language. This JavaScript project sample by A. James Liptak shows the kind of dynamic navigation features you’ll have access to once you’ve added JavaScript to your toolkit.</p>
